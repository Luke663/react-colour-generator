# Colour Generator app.

---

### Description

This project is a React-based colour shade generator, developed as part of a learning exercise to strengthen my React skills. Inspired by a [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_7Z7C_JCyo) by _freeCodeCamp\.org_, the application allows users to select or enter a colour and view dynamically generated shades and tints of that colour. The project helped me gain hands-on experience with React concepts such as state management, component structure, and user interaction. It also demonstrates practical functionality that could be useful for designers or developers working with colour palettes.
